# Guide

This is a slower introduction to Sysunit, and assumes only a basic understanding of
shell scripting. Folks who like to puzzle things out for themselves might gain a
more rapid familiarity from the [cookbook](cookbook.md).

The examples here are updated frequently with development of Sysunit and not
always, thoroughly tested, so open a
[github](https://github.com/jrforrest/sysunit) issue if they give you trouble,
or if you have a suggestion for other improvements.
